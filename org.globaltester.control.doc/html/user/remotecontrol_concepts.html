	<h2>Remote control overview</h2>

	<p>The GlobalTester provides generic remote control capabilities
		used for providing different services. The services which are
		available on your GlobalTester product are described in this category.
		The GlobalTester open source platform does not include remote control
		capabilities beyond the generic remote control framework.</p>
	<p>
		The approach to remote control is modular and the implemented features
		can be exposed independent of the feature itself. There is a SOAP
		based implementation that currently provides the default method of
		remote access. Details for this implementation can be found in the <a
			href="../../../org.globaltester.control.soap.doc/html/user/soap_reference.html">reference
			section</a> when it is installed.
